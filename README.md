 ## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

**index.html**
- This is the main HTML file that will serve as the user interface for the application.
- It should contain the necessary HTML elements to display the input fields for SQL, R method signatures, and R libraries, as well as a button to submit the data.
- The HTML should also include a section to display the generated R code.

**result.html**
- This HTML file will display the generated R code.
- It should be rendered when the user clicks the submit button on the index.html page.

### Routes

**index**
- This route will handle the GET request for the index.html page.
- It should render the index.html file.

**generate_r_code**
- This route will handle the POST request when the user clicks the submit button on the index.html page.
- It should extract the SQL, R method signatures, and R libraries from the request data.
- Using these inputs, it should generate the R code using the appropriate logic.
- Finally, it should render the result.html page, passing the generated R code as a variable.
